    <h2> Relative, Absolute and Fixed positions in CSS <span> 09.28.2014</span></h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      Today I will briefly go over some things I learned this week.  While learning CSS this week, I found myself frustrated that I couldn't figure out how to do a challenge.  It was a challenge where I had to learn how to use relative, absoulte and fixed position.<br>
        <ul>
          <li>
      <strong>Relative Position!</strong>
          </li>
          Relative position is probably the easiest to understand and explain.  Relative position places an object, table...etc relative to where it appears in the HTML code.  If you have 4 tables and you position them all as realtive they will simply sit on top of each other in the order you specified in your code.
          <li>
            <strong> Absoulte Position</strong>
          </li>
          Absoulte position is what it sounds like.  It will hold it's position no matter what.  It will overlap other items, it will stay exactly where you tell it to stay regardless of where in your code you put it.  When you set it's margins it will stay where you set it.
          <li>
            <strong>Fixed Position</strong>
          </li>
          Fixed position is that pop up that is a PAIN IN THE ASS.  When you load a website and an image or table moves as you scroll...sometimes driving you crazy...is fixed position items.  Wherever you set the margins it will maintain those margins but stay as you scroll up or down, left or right.
          So next time you're on a site and a box or image stays in a fixed position, you guessed it...Fixed position.
