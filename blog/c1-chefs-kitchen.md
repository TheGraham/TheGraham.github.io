Cultural Blog

Prior to applying to DBC, I read a lot about the culture of the school.  It's what ultimately played the biggest role in my decision to enroll.  I like how they challenge you to be good to yourself and people.  This is the culture that is missing from modern soceity.  Kindess goes a long way when it's geniune.  I am excited to get further in depth in my education here at DBC.
