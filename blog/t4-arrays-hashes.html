    <p> Arrays are used to store collections of data. Each object in an array has an unique key assigned to it. We can access any object in the array using this unique key. The positions in an array starts from " 0 ". The first element is located at " 0 ", the second at 1st position etc.<br><br><br>

      Hashes: Like arrays, Hashes are also used to store data. Hashes points an object to another object. Consider of assigning a certain "meaning" to a string. Each time you refer that string, it refers its "meaning".<br><br><br>
