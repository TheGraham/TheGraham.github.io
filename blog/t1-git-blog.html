      <strong>What are the benefits of version control?</strong><br>
      The benefits of version control are that it makes working together easy.  Imagine if a group of people had to work on the same project.  Half the team is on the east coast and the other half on the west coast.  Version control allows both teams to work together at the same time without worrying about undoing or overwriting what someone else is doing.<br>
      <strong>How does git help you keep track of changes?</strong><br>
      Git allows you to make checkpoints in the work you are doing on a file.  Each time you save your work it's a checkpoint you can go back to if you messed up and need to redo something.  The log allows you to view everyone who contributed to the project and what exactly they changed.<br>
      <strong>Why use GitHub to store your code?</strong><br>
      It's the most known and used platform to store code.  It's very user friendly as well.
