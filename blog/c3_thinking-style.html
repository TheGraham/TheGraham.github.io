      <p>This diagram pretty much sums up my learning style.  On the dot, it's actually bizarre to see it. <br>
        This first 3 weeks have been extremely tough for me.  Learning on my own is not my strong suit.<br>
        HTML/CSS I really took a liking to quickly.  Ruby not so much...not so much at all.<br>
        I requested tutoring this week and it helped me start to understand it all.  It was hard to ask for help.<br>
        I found myself in a fixed mindset this final week with Ruby.  I didn't think I had it in me. <br>
        I didn't give up and stuck to it.  Had a great tutoring session and got back on track. <br>
        Moving forawrd, I'm not gonna hesitate to ask for help.  It's natural to need guidance.  I won't be so hard on myself.<br>
