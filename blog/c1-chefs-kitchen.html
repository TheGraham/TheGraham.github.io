    <p> Prior to applying to DBC, I read a lot about the culture of the school.  It's what ultimately played the biggest role in my decision to enroll.I like how they challenge you to be good to yourself and people.  This is the culture that is missing from modern soceity.  Kindess goes a long way when it's geniune.  I am excited to get further in depth in my education here at DBC.
